write a blog on the difference between document and window object in JavaScript

Window:

>The window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser.

>This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerHeight, name, open, close, moveTo, resize etc.

>Window is the global object.

>Window object : It is the top most object and outermost element of the object hierarchy

The document:

>The document object is your html, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser.

>The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie and all properties related to DOM.

>Document object : Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object.
 The document contains the contents of the page. Using document object,
 JavaScript can modify, add and delete the HTML elements, attributes CSS styles in the page

 >The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document where as document object
 is property of window object that points to the DOM document loaded in that window.

>You can access a document object either using window.
document property or using document object directly as window is global object.
 In the below example, title is the property of document object.
